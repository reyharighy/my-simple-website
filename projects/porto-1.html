                                            This analysis is primarily intended to assess the central tendency and spread of normal rates across all observations based-on total night services, without factoring in the deviations in normal rates within individual multi-services hotels. The insights gleaned from this analysis are meant to be general assumptions that apply uniformly across the dataset.

                                            As evident from the visualization above, there exists a noteworthy variation in the deviation of normal rates among hotels that offer both 2-night and 3-night services. This deviation spans a spectrum, ranging from relatively insignificant differences to considerably significant ones. However, it's important to note that these statistics do not provide additional context regarding the nature of these differences, such as potential distinctions in room types or the features delivered.

                        Despite the notable variations in normal rates per night observed among multi-service hotels, it's essential to highlight that no distinct set of features has been identified as the cause for these differences. This underscores the need to consider this information carefully in our subsequent analyses. Furthermore, when it comes to other attributes associated with each hotel, such as star services, ratings, and the number of reviews, there are no discernible differences. These attributes remain consistent for hotels, irrespective of whether they offer multi-services or not.

                        The visualization presented above underscores Jakarta as the highest total hotel count. Notably, this trend extends beyond Jakarta, as other major urban centers closely follow in terms of hotel quantity. This observation paints a picture of Indonesia's hospitality sector, characterized by a well-distributed presence. It's worth mentioning that the top five cities on this list are also home to a various of tourist landmarks, further emphasizing the strategic importance of the hotel industry in catering to diverse influx of visitors.

                                            Kuta Alam stands out as the most densely populated hotel region in Banda Aceh, featuring an impressive count of 10 hotels. This number, comprising 38 percent of the city's total hotel availability, emphasizes the significant concentration of hotels in this specific area.

This figure is significantly higher than other regions, indicating that the preferred hotels are still concentrated in that area.

In contrast, Padjajaran doesn't make it into the top 10 based on customer feedback. This suggests that there is a significant gap in certain factors, with many people preferring hotels with average quality over those that offer superior quality.

                                            The presence of only one hotel in Denpasar indicates a limited platform affiliation within this city region.

                                            The region with the highest number of reviews falls to Ilir Timur 2, with a proportion of almost half of all the reviews in Palembang. This indicates a concentrated interest in customers' preferences.

                                            In terms of rating, this region can be considered as one with already good service quality, with an average rating that is the same as the average within the city. However, the best-rated region is Alang-Alang Lebar, which has the lowest number of reviews. This can be assumed to be a hotel with much better quality but limitations in reaching a wider customer base. This can be attributed to various factors such as pricing, limited accessibility, and relatively low popularity.

                                            Semarang Tengah emerges as the region with the highest hotel density in Semarang, featuring an impressive count of 9 hotels. This number accounts for a substantial 41 percent of the city's total hotel availability, indicating a significant concentration of hotels in this specific area. This observation underscores a notable imbalance in hotel availability across 9 regions within the city.

                                            The number of reviews based on regions in Semarang can be described as highly skewed. More than half of the reviews are held by Semarang Tengah, with a proportion of 64.97% of the total within the city. This indicates that the majority of customer preferences are concentrated in that area, leading to intense competition among hotels in the city.

This suggests that the service quality in that area is the best but is dominated by only a few hotels, indicating very limited preference variation.

However, when looking at the average rating values, this region does not make it into the top 10 regions with the best average ratings. The best average ratings are held by Setabelan, a region with very few enthusiasts, with an average rating significantly higher by 0.9 compared to the city's overall average.

                                            Genteng stands out as the most densely populated hotel region in Surabaya, boasting a substantial count of 13 hotels. This figure, accounting for 24 percent of the total hotel availability in the city, reveals that nearly a quarter of all hotels are concentrated in this area. As for the other top most availability, Wonokromo and Tegalsari are having slightly different proportion of 15 % and 16 %, respectively.

Additionally, based on service quality evaluated by the average rating per region, these three areas have relatively similar averages, although their ratings may not be the highest.

                    <p>
                        The plotted figure reveals a valuable insight into the relationship between the number of features and star services. At first glance, a positive correlation is evident from the upward trend of the red line. However, a closer examination unveils nuanced patterns. Hotels with 2 and 3-star services tend to offer fewer features than expected based on the ideal guideline represented by a straight line. Conversely, hotels with 4 and 5-star services tend to provide a significantly greater number of features, exceeding the guideline's expectations. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This observation suggests that higher-star-rated hotels generally offer a much more extensive range of features compared to their lower-star-rated counterparts, with a pronounced disparity.

                    <p>
                        Based on the visualization above, it can be concluded that there is a fairly positive relationship between star services and the number of reviews. This is evident from the red line with the trend of total reviews increasing with an increase in star services. The red line represents the regression line as a guideline or benchmark for comparison. It can be seen that hotels with 3-star services have total reviews concentrated below the red line, while for 4-star services, they are above the red line, as indicated by the denser concentration of color. Let alone, this is supported by positive correlation matrix score between them of 0.49.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This observation suggests that the higher the star services, the higher the total reviews tend to be. However, this is a general assumption and not universally applicable. It can be recommended that hotels improve their star service standards to increase the likelihood of receiving more reviews, which in turn can lead to an increase in their hotel occupancy ratio.

                    <p>
                        This insights indicate that hotels with 3-star services and above, generally assumed as good quality service, tend to have lower customers or reviews as their services prices go higher. These insights suggest that top-rated hotels are often favored by high-spending customers who are willing to pay more for exceptional services. On the other hand, hotels with 2-star services and below tend to have more customers when the prices go higher. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These might give us reasonable assumptions that hotels with utmost ratings, considered as luxury, are exclusively preferred by high spending customers who is looking for exceptional services while hotels other than that tend to have more customers as their prices are more affordable.

                    <p>
                        Based on the chart above, we can see that customers tend to prefer hotels with ratings that are not at the extreme ends. Hotels with the highest rating, labeled as <span>Luar Biasa</span>, are not very popular, likely because they are more exclusive and expensive. On the flip side, hotels with the lowest ratings, labeled as <span>Baik</span>, are also not preferred, probably because there are better-rated and more affordable alternatives available.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This insight is important because it suggests that hotels with the lowest ratings may suffer from a lack of popularity and effective marketing campaigns. To help these less-popular hotels, we can consider offering special packages and deals to boost their ratings, ultimately improving their classification and occupancy rates.

These recommendations are to elevate the company business to new heights, providing a clear path for improvement and growth. These recommendations include:

                                            <span class="accent">Delivered Features Improvement</span>: As revealed in our comprehensive Feature Basket Analysis, we have identified a set of frequently delivered features that have demonstrated a consistent ability to enhance customer satisfaction, as reflected in the ratings provided. We recommend that hotel management consider these features as benchmarking criteria for their operations. By providing these features consistently, hotels can not only meet but exceed customer expectations, fostering greater guest satisfaction and loyalty.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            It's important to note that delivering these features might come with associated costs. To strike a balance between providing enhanced amenities and ensuring affordability for customers, we suggest using the spread of the normal rate per night as a guideline. This approach not only helps maintain competitive pricing across hotels on the platform but also ensures that customers' expectations are met without compromising their budget constraints.

To further enhance customer satisfaction, we can tailor the proportion of discounts and create specific agreements with hotels that are targeted for inclusion in the discount campaigns during new year holiday. This approach not only benefits customers by offering them attractive discounts but also helps hotels unlock their true potential and gain the recognition they deserve.

                                            <span class="accent">Ongoing Exclusive Offers and Deals</span>: This means that hotels should design appealing offers that include various discounts for guests. These packages can be tailored to align with specific occasions, holidays like New Year's Eve or Valentine's Day, or local events such as festivals or conventions happening in the area. This part suggests that hotels with lower customer ratings can benefit significantly from this strategy. By offering attractive packages and promotions, they can entice guests to stay despite their lower ratings.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Consistency is key. Hotels should not offer these packages as one-time efforts but rather as ongoing strategies. Continuously providing appealing packages and promotions can lead to an improved reputation for the hotel. This means that when hotels consistently offer attractive packages, they become the preferred choice for guests. Repeat customers are more likely to choose the hotel, leading to higher occupancy rates.

                                        <p>
                                            As hotels implement these strategies and guests have positive experiences, their ratings and reviews are likely to improve over time. This is because guests are more likely to leave positive feedback when they have a satisfying stay.

                                            <span class="accent">Data Quality Compliance</span>: As data has been thoroughly analyzed, it has become evident that certain hotels offer multiple services. However, it is challenging to differentiate these services based solely on the normal rates charged to customers. This would regard different rates as having the same features delivered, which in turn affects the overall review bias applied to both services when summarizing guest feedback.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            If this scenario aligns with our expectations, it would pave the way for deeper analysis and the generation of data-driven conclusions that can provide valuable insights. One such potential insight is the ability to discern the specific services that are genuinely appreciated by customers and how these services are intertwined with pricing.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Furthermore, it would enable us to conduct a more in-depth analysis of the total reviews based on this differentiation. This would allow us to pinpoint specific service types that are frequently preferred by customers, providing a granular understanding of what aspects of the hotel's offerings resonate most with guests.

                            This project aims to showcase the integration of technologies to build an intelligent and interactive chatbot that runs locally. 
                            The main focus is to take advantage of the Llama 2 as open source Large Language Model developed by Meta AI. 
                            While building with Llama 2, this project is intended to leverage its factual accuracy and consistency by providing it with reliable 
                            and up-to-date information from the knowledge base. Achieving this involves the model with Pinecone as external database that could be used to store such novel information.
                            Lastly, we can establish the real environment using streamlit library as chatbot UI.
