                        Introduction
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Olist, a Brazilian e-commerce marketplace integrator referred to their <a href="https://olist.com/pt-br/" target="_blank"><span>website</span></a>, is an online e-commerce platform designed to facilitate direct sales on e-commerce sites of Brazil. The company's platform connects entrepreneurs with major online retailers and allows shopkeepers to advertise and sell in the marketplaces without complication, enabling retail companies to reach out to the international marketplaces, improve the shopping experience and modify their purchasing behavior.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Olist connects small businesses from all over Brazil to channels without hassle and with a single contract. Those merchants are able to sell their products through the Olist Store and ship them directly to the customers using Olist logistics partners. After a customer purchases the product from, a seller gets notified to fulfill that order. Once the customer receives the product, or the estimated delivery date is due, the customer gets a satisfaction survey by email where he can give a note for the purchase experience and write down some comments.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        Context
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        The dataset has information of 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. Its features allows viewing an order from multiple dimensions: from order status, price, payment and freight performance to customer location, product attributes and finally reviews written by customers.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        Problem Statements
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Olist have collected data throughout the year, the data contains seperated information, there are aggregated data, unique data or even combination of both. With olist current dataset, it is hard to identify customer behaviour since it has no representation of customer segments. Moreover, even after understanding the segmentation, what kind of approach should they take?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hence, the questions to be answered in this project:

                    <p>
                        With this project, it is hoped that Olist will be able to classify their customers with the appropriate segmentation.

                    <p>
                        The machine learning model built is limited to orders from 2016 to 2018. Thus, the performance of the model will be much different when used to classify customers from today. In addition, this model is built from several selected features based on features importance and correlation analysis to the target.

This may happen because more customers have free time during the lunch breaks. The second most is during night while customers have more free time after all day work.

This might happen because many new customers are transacting on Olist in 2018. Therefore, this case should be investigated further in modelling.

                                        The highest value sold in history is on November 2017. It's possible that this can be happen when the blackfriday event is held, where each store probably gives a massive discount that only happens for 1 day. The value is 1001.9K just for 1 month.

A sharp increase occurred in the July 2018. This might be happened because many new customer come to use Olist as their daily e-commerce to do shopping.

                                        The mean value of freight paid is R$ 22.77 yet there are still many states that must paid more for freight value above R$ 40. The top 5 are Paraiba, Roraima, Rondonia, Acre, and Maranhao.

The evolution of payment types with credit card is also increasing rapidly from January 2017 to May 2018. Many customers also preffered to take 1 month payment installments.

                                        There is a growing trend on e-commerce sales in Brazil when the total amount sold between 2017 to 2018 is increased to 137.04%. The highest value sold in history was on November 2017 with 1001.9K just for 1 month. This could be happen because the blackfriday event is held on that month, where each sellers probably gives a massive discount that only happens for 1 day.

                                        The biggest mean price by customer state is Paraiba with R$215, but the amount price tend to be low with just R$113.40K. Inversely proportional to Sao Paulo where the mean price is lowest, but had the biggest amount price comparing to another states with R$5172.26K. This is how total sales is concentraded in Brazil.

                                        The credit card is the most preferred payment choice by customers with 73.99% from total. The evolution of payment types with credit card is also increasing rapidly from January 2017 to May 2018. Many customers also preffered to take 1 month payment installments. This indicates that payment with a credit card, many customers do not need to immediately pay in full for the products they bought. They can pay it with installments they preffered and can be paid at the end of the periods. Vouchers can also be used for payments, with this, customers can get discounts for the products that they bought and add more products to buy. This is how payment types can take influence on e-commerce.

                            In the telecom industry, marketing professionals place a strong emphasis on keeping customers from
                            switching to rival companies because it's much more cost-effective to retain existing customers than
                            to acquire new ones. Retention is a top priority, and a common strategy involves offering special
                            packages. However, this can be expensive if extended to all customers since only a small fraction
                            typically consider leaving, or "churning". To address this challenge, a predictive model will be
                            created to generate churn scores as indicators. These scores will help identify early signs of potential
                            churn, allowing the company to take proactive measures to prevent customers from actually unsubscribing.
