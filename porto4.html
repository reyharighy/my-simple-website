                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that structures code around the concept of "objects". 
                        Objects are instances of classes, which are templates or blueprints for creating objects. 
                        OOP focuses on modeling real-world entities and their interactions using classes and objects. 
                        It promotes encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism as core concepts.
                    </p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 30px;">
                        Python is a popular programming language known for its simplicity and ease of use. 
                        One of the most common applications of Python is for creating CRUD application to a wide range of use cases. 
                        As for my project, this can be useful for managing and manipulating amounts of personal patient data by providing an easy-to-use interface which is customized to meet specific requirements or additional features such as data validation. 
                        As for the storage file format, we will be using CSV (Comma-Separated Values) which is a lightweight and accessible file format used for storing tabular data, or information presented in a table with rows and columns.
                        Overall, this is just a small start of understanding the basic concepts of creating CRUD application in Object-oriented Programming Paradigm.

                    <h2 style="font-weight: bolder; color:#339999; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 30px;">CRUD Operations</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        CRUD is an acronym that stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. 
                        It refers to the basic operations that are commonly performed on data stored in a database that provides an interface for users to interact with a database by performing these basic operations.
                        Here's a brief description of each of the CRUD operations.
                        <ol style="margin-top: -15px; text-align: justify;">
                            <li>
                                Create: This operation is used to create new data in the database.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Read: This operation is used to retrieve data from the database.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Update: This operation is used to modify existing data in the database.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Delete: This operation is used to remove data from the database.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        The application may also include additional features such as authentication, authorization, validation, and error handling to ensure that data is processed correctly and securely.
                        In summary, a CRUD application is important because it provides an efficient and scalable way to manage data, automate tasks, and customize the application to meet specific business requirements. 
                        For example, in data management, it allows users to manage data easily and efficiently. 
                        Users can create, read, update, and delete data in a database with a few clicks or taps, without having to write complex SQL queries.
                    </p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        This project presents an example of a personal patient record in a hospital, with a focus on the necessary patient data. 
                        The hospital name and type are not specified, but the project outlines the patient information required, including patient's identifier (ID), name, place of birth, birthdate, gender, and phone number. 
                        An ID is unique and non-repeating label that is used to identify a patient that later is used to retrieve or update the record. 
                        They are going to be represented as numbers. Here are detailed format and example of each data:
                        <ol style="margin-top: -15px; text-align: justify;">
                            <li>
                                Identifier (ID): a 16-digit numeric data type that's manually entered.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Name: a string data type that's manually entered.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Place of birth: a string data type that's manually entered.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Birthdate: a string data type that's manually entered.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Gender: a string data type that's manually entered.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Phone Number: a numeric data type that's manually entered.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        When working with CSV files, it's important to store all data as strings because CSV files do not have a standardized data type system. 
                        If data is not stored as a string, it may be interpreted as a different data type, leading to errors in data processing. 
                        By storing all data as strings, it can be parsed into a data structure and converted to the appropriate data type after reading the file. 
                        This ensures that the data is correctly interpreted and processed according to its intended data type.
                    </p>

                        When working with CSV files as a database, we use Command-Line Interface (CLI) to interact with the files instead of a graphical user interface (GUI). 
                        CLI can be used in CRUD applications and is particularly useful when efficiency, flexibility, portability, or security are important factors.

                        The provided code snippet is all about loading patient records from a CSV file and processing the data to create a list of dictionaries. 
                        Let's break it down step by step:
                        <ol style="margin-top: -15px; text-align: justify;">
                            <li>
                                The "<span class="variables">csv</span>" module is imported, which allows us to work with CSV files.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The code enters a "<span class="variables">with</span>" block, where it opens a CSV file named "<span class="variables">records-oop.csv</span>" in read mode ('r') with UTF-8 encoding. 
                                The "<span class="variables">with</span>" statement ensures proper handling of the file, automatically closing it when done.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                An empty list named "<span class="variables">patients_list</span>" is created. This list will store the processed patient records.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The "<span class="variables">csv.DictReader</span>" is used to read the CSV file. 
                                It treats the first row as headers and each subsequent row as a dictionary with header values as keys.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                A loop iterates through each row in the CSV file (excluding the header).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The value in the "<span class="variables">id_number</span>" column of the current row is converted to an integer and stored back in the same dictionary under the "<span class="variables">id_number</span>" key.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The value in the "<span class="variables">birth_date</span>" column of the current row is processed. 
                                It's split into parts, and each part is converted to an integer to represent the year, month, and day of birth. 
                                These integers are stored as a list under the "<span class="variables">birth_date</span>" key in the same dictionary.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The modified dictionary (row) is appended to the "<span class="variables">patients_list</span>", creating a list of patient records.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                After processing all rows, the "<span class="variables">with</span>" block ensures the CSV file is properly closed.

                        This section of code focuses on saving patient records to a CSV file and then terminating the program. 
                        Here's an explanation of what's happening:
                        <ol style="margin-top: -15px; text-align: justify;">
                            <li>

                                It indicates whether the program should be terminated and whether patient records should be saved.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Inside this condition, a "<span class="variables">with</span>" block is used to open a CSV file named "<span class="variables">records-oop.csv</span>" in write mode ('w') with UTF-8 encoding for saving data.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                A "<span class="variables">csv.DictWriter</span>" is created. 
                                It's responsible for writing dictionaries (rows) into the CSV file. 
                                The fieldnames parameter specifies the order and names of the columns in the CSV file.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                "<span class="variables">writer.writeheader()</span>": This writes the header row with the column names specified in fieldnames to the CSV file.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                "<span class="variables">writer.writerows(patients_list)</span>": This writes the list of dictionaries (patient records) stored in the "<span class="variables">patients_list</span>" to the CSV file.

                        In summary, this section of code checks whether the program should be terminated. 
                        If it should be terminated, it saves the patient records to a CSV file named "<span class="variables">records-oop.csv</span>", prints a termination message, and then ends the program execution. 
                        This ensures that the patient records are properly saved before the program closes.

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        In this project, we have successfully created a CRUD application using Python and CSV files as a database. 
                        This type of application is ideal for small-scale projects and is a great way to learn about the fundamentals of building CRUD applications in Python.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        We have gained valuable experience in Python programming, CSV file handling, and CLI application development. 
                        We have also learned how to perform the four essential CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) on data stored in CSV files.
                        While CSV files are a good starting point for managing small amounts of data, they may not be suitable for larger-scale applications. 
                        For more extensive projects, we may want to consider using a more robust database management system like MySQL or PostgreSQL.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        In addition, building your own CRUD application will give you the opportunity to tailor it to your specific needs and requirements. 
                        You can experiment with different frameworks, databases, and data structures to find the best combination that works for you.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 30px;">
                        Overall, building your own CRUD application is an excellent way to challenge yourself and take your programming skills to the next level. 
                        Don't be afraid to start small and work your way up to more advanced projects. 
                        With persistence and dedication, you can achieve great things and become a proficient Python developer.
