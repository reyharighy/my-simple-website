                                This project aims to showcase the integration of technologies to build an intelligent and interactive chatbot that runs locally. 
                                The main focus is to take advantage of the Llama 2 as open source Large Language Model developed by Meta AI. 
                                While building with Llama 2, this project is intended to leverage its factual accuracy and consistency by providing it with reliable 
                                and up-to-date information from the knowledge base. Achieving this involves the model with Pinecone as external database that could be used to store such novel information.
                                Lastly, we can establish the real environment using streamlit library as chatbot UI.

                                Olist have collected separated information data throughout the year. With current dataset,
                                it is hard to identify customer behaviour. However, the existing dataset poses a challenge
                                in comprehending customer behavior as it lacks a delineation of customer segments. The aspiration
                                of this project lies in empowering Olist to discern and classify their customers into meaningful
                                segments. This segmentation process will enable Olist to gain invaluable insights, refine their
                                marketing strategies, and provide personalized experiences, ultimately fostering enhanced customer
                                satisfaction and optimizing their business operations.

                                In the telecom industry, marketing professionals place a strong emphasis on keeping customers from
                                switching to rival companies because it's much more cost-effective to retain existing customers than
                                to acquire new ones. Retention is a top priority, and a common strategy involves offering special
                                packages. However, this can be expensive if extended to all customers since only a small fraction
                                typically consider leaving, or "churning". To address this challenge, a predictive model will be
                                created to generate churn scores as indicators. These scores will help identify early signs of potential
                                churn, allowing the company to take proactive measures to prevent customers from actually unsubscribing.
