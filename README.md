# Simple Website Using Github Pages
Make a simple HTML website and publish it using Github Pages.  

This website is intended as personal branding and I would love to share all publications.

Credit to <a href="https://hangar.co/" target="_blank">Hangar</a> as an inspiration of building up this website since I know a zip in web development and have no purpose in being web developper. I just pragmatically apply all the things required to establish a website and only do this merely for the intention previously mentioned.

Hope you guys find my website essential and useful. Thank you!
