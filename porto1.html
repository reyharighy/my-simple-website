                    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Introduction</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        Olist, a Brazilian e-commerce marketplace integrator referred to their <a href="https://olist.com/pt-br/">website</a>, is an online e-commerce platform designed to facilitate direct sales on e-commerce sites of Brazil.
                        The company's platform connects entrepreneurs with major online retailers and allows shopkeepers to advertise and sell in the marketplaces without complication, enabling retail companies to reach out to the international marketplaces, improve the shopping experience and modify their purchasing behavior.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify;">
                        Olist connects small businesses from all over Brazil to channels without hassle and with a single contract. 
                        Those merchants are able to sell their products through the Olist Store and ship them directly to the customers using Olist logistics partners. 
                        After a customer purchases the product from, a seller gets notified to fulfill that order. 
                        Once the customer receives the product, or the estimated delivery date is due, the customer gets a satisfaction survey by email where he can give a note for the purchase experience and write down some comments.
                    </p>

                    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Context</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        The dataset has information of 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. 
                        Its features allows viewing an order from multiple dimensions: from order status, price, payment and freight performance to customer location, product attributes and finally reviews written by customers. 
                    </p>

                    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Problem Statements</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 10px;">
                        Olist have collected data throughout the year, the data contains seperated information, there are aggregated data, unique data or even combination of both. 
                        With olist current dataset, it is hard to identify customer behaviour since it has no representation of customer segments. 
                        Moreover, even after understanding the segmentation, what kind of approach should they take? 
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Hence, the questions to be answered in this project:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Is there any growing trend on e-commerce sales in Brazil?</li>
                            <li>How the total sales is concentraded in brazilian states?</li>
                            <li>What are the best states to do transaction in Brazil?</li>
                            <li>How payments types can take influence on e-commerce?</li>
                            <li>How are the behaviour of our customer?</li>
                            <li>How would you classify them?</li>
                            <li>How CRM campaign strategy be implemented?</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>

                    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Objective</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        With this project, it is hoped that Olist will be able to classify their customers with the appropriate segmentation.
                    </p>
                
                    <h3>Project Limitation</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        The machine learning model built is limited to orders from 2016 to 2018. 
                        Thus, the performance of the model will be much different when used to classify customers from today. 
                        In addition, this model is built from several selected features based on features importance and correlation analysis to the target.
                    </p>

                    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Analytical Approach</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 10px;">
                        Underlying the problem statements, our main focus lies around the implementation of CRM Campaign, the analytical approach we use are:

                    <p style="margin-top: 10px; text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 30px;">
                        There are nine sets of data provided at the expense of Olist E-Commerce which are freely accessible for the research purposes.
                        Please directly go through this <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce">link</a> for data sets information.
                        As merging process based-on data schemes shown above, we inherited three data sets named as Order History, Customer Payments, and Recency-Frequency-Monetary Table.

                    <h3>Evolution of Total Orders in Brazilian E-Commerce</h3>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: -10px;">Insights:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li style="text-align: justify;">There is no record on November 2016 and incomplete records on September 2018. The highest orders received in 1 month is on November 2017.</li>
                        <li style="text-align: justify;">Based on total orders by the day of week, Monday and Tuesday are the most transaction happened in a week with 16.29% and 16.05% from total.</li>
                        <li style="text-align: justify;">
                            In total orders by time of the day, it can be seen that afternoon is the most transaction happened in a day with 38.29% from total. 
                            This may happen because more customers have free time during the lunch breaks. The second most is during night while customers have more free time after all day work.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                        <li style="text-align: justify;">
                            Based on comparison plot above, it can be seen that there was an increase in orders of 136.52% between January and August in 2017 to January and August in 2018. 
                            This might happen because many new customers are transacting on Olist in 2018. Therefore, this case should be investigated further in modelling.    
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                        <li style="text-align: justify;">
                            Based on Evolution of E-Commerce Orders on Brazilian Regions plot, it can be seen that Brazil is divided into 5 major regions, where the South East is the region with the fastest evolution of e-commerce orders from January 2017 to August 2018. 
                            Meanwhile Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro from South East region are also in the 1st and 2nd place for top orders in each states and cities.

                    <ul>
                        <li style="text-align: justify;">
                            The highest value sold in history is on November 2017. It's possible that this can be happen when the blackfriday event is held, where each store probably gives a massive discount that only happens for 1 day. 
                            The value is 1001.9K just for 1 month.    
                        </li>
                        <li style="text-align: justify;">
                            The total amount between January and August in 2017 to January and August in 2018 is also increased 137.04% where Evolution of Average Freight Value tend to be stable from January 2017 to May 2018. 
                            A sharp increase occurred in the July 2018. This might be happened because many new customer come to use Olist as their daily e-commerce to do shopping.    
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Comparative Study: E-Commerce Delivery Performance</h3>
                    <img src="./images/insight5.png" style="width: 85%; margin-left: 7.5%; margin-bottom: 20px;">

                    <ul>
                        <li style="text-align: justify;">
                            The mean value of freight paid is R$22.77 yet there are still many states that must paid more for freight value above R$40. 
                            The top 5 are Paraiba, Roraima, Rondonia, Acre, and Maranhao.    
                        </li>
                        <li style="text-align: justify;">
                            Even Roraima State is also in top 2 of 5 states with highest average time to delivery. 
                            This needs to be discussed further between the Olist team, so the freight value can be adjusted and each customer gets the best delivery service at the right price.    
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                            Based on 3 plot above, it can be seen that credit card is the most preferred payment choice by customers with 73.99% from total. 
                            The evolution of payment types with credit card is also increasing rapidly from January 2017 to May 2018. 
                            Many customers also preffered to take 1 month payment installments. 
                            This indicates that payment with a credit card, customers do not need to immediately pay in full for the products they buy. 
                            They can pay it with installments they preffered and can be paid at the end of the periods.    
                        </li>
                        <li style="text-align: justify;">
                            The most payment installments that customer preffered is 1. 
                            It indicates that many customers buy products that are not too expensive and are still able to be paid at the end of the first month.

                        Based on feature importances quantified by SHAP value or Shapley, the two most important features are total_price and total_freight. 
                        Meanwhile, other features seem to have insignificant impacts on model output as shown above. 
                        This result does not imply the correlation nor the relationship of the features to the output, merely the significance power of the features to the output itself.

                                This could be happen because the blackfriday event is held on that month, where each sellers probably gives a massive discount that only happens for 1 day.

                                The evolution of payment types with credit card is also increasing rapidly from January 2017 to May 2018. 
                                Many customers also preffered to take 1 month payment installments. 
                                This indicates that payment with a credit card, many customers do not need to immediately pay in full for the products they bought. 
                                They can pay it with installments they preffered and can be paid at the end of the periods.
